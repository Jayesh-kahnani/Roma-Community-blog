          <p>
            Romani people are an ethnic minority group but they have a rich and
            complex history and culture. They are famous for their bright color
            clothes. They are also known as gypsies. There are a lot of things
            that need to be clarified regarding the origin of Romani people in
            India. They support linguistics, genetics, and culture as same as
            India. By understanding their language and culture we defined them as
            they migrated from the centre of India to northern India. After their
            diaspora from India, they migrated towards Greece. After this, they
            spread into Europe. The lexicon (vocabulary of the Romani language) is
            similar to some Greek words. They show the socio-cultural institutions
            and traditions of India. Research also shows that some Romani people
            share their genetic markers with some northern people of India. After
            India, they spread over the Greeks. Some similar words are found in
            the Greek language in the lexicon which shows the relation between the
            Greek and Romani people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the connections are in fever to show the Indianess of Romani
            people, the language also plays an important role in it. The Romani
            language is also an Indo-Aryan language. there are many words taken
            from Persia more than Armenia in lexicon the vocabulary of Romani
            people. But it is not right that they lived in Persia more than
            Armenia, there are some economic relations among them there are no
            linguistic relations more than Armenia people with Persian people.
            These people believe in different religions. Some of them have beliefs
            in Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam but some of them do not follow
            them at all. The religious practices of Indians have greatly
            influenced the development of various religious beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about discrimination, it is a major issue faced by many
            people, especially the Romani community who are often targeted
            unfairly. People are being victimized due to the nationalization of
            others. Many people do this to migrate to avoid assimilation and that
            is why they are afraid to become part of any particular society.
            Unfortunately, this decision can also lead to recent challenges such
            as poverty, social marginalization, and discrimination. These are the
            tough issues in society. This can be improved with the support of
            society and the positive thoughts of people. Dom is a caste that
            belonged to India. Dom means a man of the Dalit caste. Those live
            their life by singing and dancing. Currently, these individuals are
            located in India. Some of them are dancers, musicians, workers, etc.
            This caste is not linguistic or ethnic as well. These people are
            present in the west of India like Iran, Pakistan, and Europe. Dalit is
            used for those who are untouchables. This can be the reason behind the
            minority and discrimination against the Romani people at present.
            Today also the Romani people are famous for their art and crafts and
            weaving of baskets in Europe. They have come to stay primarily because
            of their economic conditions. They adopt these skills in India to
            improve their economic conditions. As they are migratory people in the
            past they had some other passion for living their life in a difficult
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Romani community is proficient in creating literature that
            effectively depicts their cultural heritage and history. They are
            famous for their romanticized literature. On the other hand, western
            countries observe the literature as having more misconceptions about
            the Romani people. This was the time of the Benzatime empire. The
            group of Athingani is one of the population of that empire. This one
            is equated with Roma by some researchers. They relate these people
            with Romas with the caste system in India. The Greek word Athingani
            means those who don't want to touch others. At that time this term is
            popular in India. In some research, the first time this word was found
            in a religious text. They used this word for those who tell fortune
            and arrange ceremonies. It demonstrates how two words from different
            origins can have similar meanings. The most famous and important thing
            is the photography and their paintings. Nowadays, the Romani paintings
            are more popular in all over the world. They fill some colors to show
            the real thing in front of the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deterritorialization of the Romani people was described based on
            their history, cultural adaptions, and experience as a global
            diasporic community. Linguistic and cultural anthropology played an
            important role in the development. Romani people lived in a nomadic
            lifestyle. They face more struggles in their diaspora. While migrating
            from one place to another, they were always willing to take the
            culture of their new surroundings.

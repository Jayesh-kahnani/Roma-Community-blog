          </div>            Romani Representation in prose has a long history of itself. Some of the most notable examples of Romani representation in prose include Carmen by Prosper Mérimée, Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and La Gitanilla by Miguel de Cervantes. Other than this acclaimed writers and poets like Shakespeare and William Wordsworth have also drawn inspiration from Romani people in their characters. 
<p></p>
         
            In this blog, we will focus on Carmen by Prosper Mérimée and understand the representation of Romani people, particularly Romani women in the piece. We will examine Carmen, the character, and the context of the time to understand the impact of the work on shaping the perceptions of the Romani community. 
 </p>
          <p>
Written as a four-act novella in 1845, Carmen, both as the character and the story, became popular throughout the globe after the adaptation to an opera of the same name by Georges Bizet. The opera is known to be one of the most successful ones to date in terms of popularity and has further become an inspiration for various paintings, ballets, songs and films, many of which go by the same name. 
<br> Very much like the original, this blog is divided into 4 acts (plot, character, context, impact), each talking about Carmen and Romanis from a different point of view.

       <p></p>   <h5>Act I: Plot - A Melodramatic Tale of Love and Anguish

 </h5>

The novelle tells the story of a bandit named Don José who falls in love with a beautiful Romani woman and abandons his career as a soldier becoming a thief and murderer by joining her gang. Later, José is able to get Carmen married to him when he kills her then-husband. However, Carmen uses her attractions to further the gang’s success and is soon attracted to a youth named Lucas. Realizing that Carmen would not love him as much as he loves her, José is overcome with spiraling jealousy. By the end of it, José ends up stabbing Carmen and going to prison. 
<br> <p> Prosper Mérimée, an archaeologist and the French author of the novella, is the narrator and a character of the story who happened to have struck a friendship with José during one of his archaeological excursions and hears about the tale from José when he is in prison and about to be executed. 
      </p>
    
   
   <p></p>   <h5>Act II: Carmen the Character -  The Enchanting Master of Wiles
 </h5>
 Carmen, the center of the story, is a Romani or “gypsy” who is shown to be an alluring woman who is lively and free-spirited. She is portrayed as someone who is fearless, does what she wants and goes with who she likes. She is shown to be a dangerous woman who refuses to be confronted by patriarchal societal norms. These, along with her fortune-telling abilities, exotic style, involvement in criminal activities and tragic end, make Carmen to be in line with the common Romani troupe, a future archetype. But more than anything Carmen in the 19th century was a “savage and dangerous woman who could threaten society and lead good men astray.”  
<br> One instance from the book that clearly shows this idea is when Carmen injured her coworker by cutting an “x” on her face during a quarrel in the factory where both Carmen and José worked. José, one of the soldiers in charge of guarding the place is ordered to arrest Carmen leading to the first interaction between the two alone. Carmen manages to convince José to release her by speaking Basque and highlighting that they are from the same native place. This scene highlights Carmen’s brutality when attacking her coworker and her dangerously charming wiles that make José release her knowing fully well that he shouldn’t. 
<p>However, what makes Carmen, the novella, dangerous is that Carmen is a manifestation of the many stereotypes regarding Romani women that were and to an extent are still prevalent. And it is not just the novella being influenced by the popular opinion of the time. The converse was also true. But before we get into that, it is important to understand the setting in which Carmen became known to the world.

<h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKNoVOBgVbI">Carmen Fantasy</a> <br>Act III: Historical Context - Generations of Suspicion and Discrimination 
</h5>
          <p>
This novella and the more widely known opera adaptation came at a sensitive time when French attitudes towards the Romani had long turned hostile. In 1802, 500 Romani in the French Basque provinces had been imprisoned and were to be deported to the then colony of Louisiana (Coincidentally, José happens to have hailed from the same province). However, the deportation did not take place and the imprisoned Romani were released four years later. 
<br>Suspicion against the “alien and different” group continued to remain high until it hit a high at the beginning of the next century when the Romani were mandated to carry “special” identity cards which included details like photographs, fingerprints and lengths of the right ear. During the next few years, Romani communities throughout Europe would face increasing regulation and suspicion as practices like mandating identity cards, expulsion, restricting movement and forcing Romani children away from their families became increasingly common. Given the changes in policies and regulations at the state level, it is not hard to guess what was happening on the ground. Romani people were unsurprisingly subjected to continuous exclusion, discrimination and marginalization.

<h5>Act IV: Effect on Discourse About Romani - A Timeless Poison
</h5>Neither the novella nor the opera gained particular enthusiasm for years after they first emerged in the world of arts. However, by the late 1880s, Carmen was on its way to becoming the hit we know it as today. As Carmen spread beyond the seas, so did the image of Romani women. The creators of Carmen have long passed. However, Carmen has continued to live on to be the timeless tale and with it, poisonous repercussions linger.
</p>
<p>“<a href="page2.html">The Melodic Resilience: Romani People in Songs and Raps</a>” mentions that the “perpetuation of stereotypes in songs and rap has been a persistent challenge for the Romani community.” This unfortunately is also true with the case of Carmen. 
<br>Carmen's widespread popularity meant that the character, with all its complexities and stereotypes, had become one of the most recognizable depictions of Romani women in the world of art at the time. As such, what were the “character traits” of a non-existent being (although inspired by pre-existing stereotypes), soon came to be the first thing many people knew about women from the ethnic group. 
<br>The recurring use of Carmen's character in various adaptations, films, and artistic interpretations and the forming of Carmen as an archetype for female Romani characters has further contributed to the enduring popularity of the character and the reinforcement of the abovementioned stereotypes associated with Romani women. Such reinforcements have somewhere confirmed existing biases and served to justify discriminatory practices and social exclusion.

          The people were actually “The Roma” but they are known to the world as
          “The Gypsies”. This community is well known to be exiled,
          discriminated against, separated and enslaved almost in every region
          they go. There is even a gypsy proverb that goes like - “Bury me
          standing up for, I've been on my knees all my life.” This proverb
          alone explains how excluded the gypsies were in European societies
          since they entered that land. There are actually many literary works
          that describe the roma community. They are generally known to be dark
          coloured, moving from town to town, telling fortunes and playing
          hypnotic tunes on their violins along with their carts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yale strom who was a filmmaker and a musician says that - “Fortune
          tellers”, “ Palm readers”, “ crystal ball”, “ violinists”, “dancers”,
          “long dresses" are some of the positive terms that are told by
          children when they are asked about the gypsies. The negatives are
          “untrustworthy”, “stealing children”, “promiscuous”. All the
          information that we get from people about gypsies is from newspaper
          articles, tv series, movie characters or from traditional gypsy
          folklore only. The actual real gypsies are very little known. Gordon
          Boswell, a gypsy, seems to be very proud of his race, his background,
          and his people and would say the same when someone asks “Are you a
          gypsy?”. There are almost 8 to 12 million Romani people in almost
          every continent of the world. This distinct group of people settled in
          different places in different communities and often integrated into
          the general population. No matter how many different kinds of gypsies
          exist, they all have a common origin point and are ultimately
          connected to the same heritage and are related to each other.
          Generally, most of the romanies can recognise another romani anytime,
          anywhere. Most of the romanies are dark skinned and have dark eyes and
          black hair. This nomadic community entered Europe in the 14th century
          and by that time, nobody knew their homeland, their culture nor their
          country. But they continued to maintain their identity by living in
          close bonds and protecting their community along with their common
          language called “Romani”. The superstitions and myths around the
          romani people are because of their secretive nature. They left no
          records but just passed their culture and identity onto the future
          generations. That's why most of the information about them in
          literature and movies is from outsiders and they were viewed with
          misconceptions by non gypsies who were referred to as “Gadje”.
        </p>
        <h6> How were gypsies treated from historical times..? </h6>
        <p>
          The romanies were treated as strangers in every country they entered
          and were even hunted like animals in some places in the mid 19th
          century. During the second world war, they were targeted by Hitler and
          were killed in mass numbers in his death camps. In the United States,
          gypsies would hide their race as they were afraid of revealing their
          true identity and live alongside the Americans in the 20th century. In
          some regions of the world, it was even legal to kill romanies and to
          enslave them. In Europe, they were not even allowed to take water from
          wells. From historical times, there is no single case that they were
          not discriminated against but today they are survivors and know how to
          survive as a group.

          <h6> Where exactly do they originate from..?<br /></h6>
          The answer to this question would be traced from their musical
          evidence. They were more associated with their contribution to music.
          Their language in music gives a sense of longing for tunes and words
          which further leads our thoughts to identify the path of their
          departure. So their language is basically related to Sanskrit which
          has its roots in India. What is interesting is that the romani
          language is similar to hindi, punjabi and other north Indian
          languages. It is also proven by anthropological blood tests that the
          romani people resemble the warrior classes of India. The question
          “where did gypsies originate from?” has witnessed many debates and
          controversies and finally it is believed that they started their
          migration from North western india. These people are found in almost
          every continent across the globe including the regions of Turkey,
          Middle east. 
          How did they enter Europe? While they began from India,
          they moved towards the Caspian sea and crossed caucasus mountains and
          reached the Byzantine empire. Along with their visits to different
          countries and regions, many new words have been added to their
          language. In the Byzantine empire, they had lived for almost 100
          years. They were skilled in metal works there. There were actually
          records that describe gypsies as fortune tellers, herbal healers and
          entertainers also. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, they
          shifted their way to Europe. Some gypsies escaped from the feudal
          difficulties by the Turks in eastern europe. When they moved to
          Europe, people started to assume them as travelers from Egypt and
          that's how they got the name “Gypsies”. The gypsies currently make up
          almost 14 percent of the population of Europe. Many legislations or
          laws against them were made in eastern europe back then. The slavery
          treatment and exclusion they faced everywhere made them hide their
          identity to the outsiders which brought them a tagline that they were
          liars. The saddest part is that the gypsies had nowhere to go in the
          whole world and they were brutally persecuted everywhere they went.
          They lived as strangers and outsiders in every land. They were treated
          very badly because of the way they dressed, the way they looked and
          because of speaking the language that was never heard or known to
          anyone. The gypsies would move from one place that they don’t belong
          to another place that they still don’t belong to. The gypsy community
          has a great history that was filled with many superstitious beliefs,
          false ideas and a bitter past.
